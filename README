NAME
       efsextract - extract files from SGI CD images or EFS file systems

SYNOPSIS
       efsextract [OPTION] [FILE]
       efsextract [-h|-V]

DESCRIPTION
       efsextract extracts files from an SGI CD image, or an EFS file
       system.

       Silicon Graphics (SGI) was a computer company that existed from 1981
       to 2009. During this period, they shipped software for their
       computers, sometimes on CD, and often not using the standard ISO9660
       file system.  These discs are instead simply hard disc images
       pressed to CD. Thus, they have an SGI disk label and an EFS
       partition.

       Most systems cannot understand this sort of disc format. This tool
       was developed to allow non-SGI systems to at least be able to
       extract files from such discs.

OPTIONS
       -h     Print a usage message on standard output and exit
	      successfully.

       -l     List files without extracting.

       -L     List partitions and bootfiles.

       -o ARCHIVE
	      Instead of extracting, create a tar archive ARCHIVE
	      containing all files from the image.

       -p NUM Use partition number NUM (default: 7).

       -q     Do not show file listing while extracting.

       -W     Instead of extracting, scan the image for `inst' packages and
	      list them.

       -V     Print version information on standard output and exit
	      successfully.
